# üõ°Ô∏è Safe Rust bindings for `libselinux`

SELinux is a flexible Mandatory Access Control for Linux.

This crate supports `libselinux` from version `2.8` to `3.2`.
Later versions might still be compatible.
This crate exposes neither *deprecated* nor *undocumented* SELinux API functions
and types.

‚ö†Ô∏è This crate is Linux-specific. Building it for non-Linux platforms, or for
the Linux kernel, results in an empty crate.

This documentation is too brief to cover SELinux.
Please refer to the [official SELinux documentation], the manual pages of
the [`libselinux`] native library, and the [`selinux-sys`] crate for a more
complete picture on how to use this crate.

## Cargo features

### ‚öì Backward compatibility

This crate requires `libselinux` version `2.8`, at least.
However, this crate provides some functions that are based on `libselinux`
functions implemented in later versions.
When such newer functions are needed, this crate attempts to load them
dynamically at runtime.
If such functions are implemented by `libselinux`, then the called crate
functions run as expected.
If the needed functions are not implemented by `libselinux`, then an error is
returned indicating that the called crate function is unsupported.
